Create a comprehensive web application for Educational Attendance Management that connects to my REST API running on http://localhost:5000

The API provides these endpoints:
- Students: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /students
- Teachers: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /teachers  
- Subject Sets: GET/POST /subject-sets
- Classes: GET/POST /classes
- Sessions: GET/POST/PUT /sessions
- Attendance: GET/POST/PUT /attendance and /attendance/session/:id
- Face Data: GET/POST/DELETE /face-data

API Configuration to use:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000';
const API_HEADERS = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Accept': 'application/json' };

async function apiRequest(endpoint, method = 'GET', data = null) {
  const config = { method, headers: API_HEADERS, mode: 'cors' };
  if (data) config.body = JSON.stringify(data);
  
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}${endpoint}`, config);
  const result = await response.json();
  if (!result.success) throw new Error(result.message);
  return result;
}
```

Build a modern web app with these features:
1. Dashboard showing attendance statistics
2. Student management (add/edit/view students with profile images)
3. Teacher management (add/edit/view teachers)
4. Class scheduling and session management
5. Attendance tracking with Present/Absent/Late status
6. Campus-based filtering (BKK, SGN, etc.)
7. Face recognition data upload support

Sample API calls:
- Get students: `await apiRequest('/students')`
- Create student: `await apiRequest('/students', 'POST', {StudentCode:'STU001', StudentName:'John Doe', EmailAddress:'john@example.com', Campus:'BKK', Form:'10A'})`
- Get attendance: `await apiRequest('/attendance/session/1')`

The API returns data in format: `{success: true, message: "...", data: {...}}`

All endpoints support CORS and use JSON. Handle errors gracefully and show loading states. Make it responsive and user-friendly for educational staff to manage attendance efficiently.
